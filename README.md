# 🧠 Carentix: Optimal Vitamin Deficiency Finder

An AI-powered deep learning system to detect vitamin deficiencies from user-submitted images and symptoms, built using AlexNet and image processing techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Vitamin deficiencies often go undiagnosed due to vague or non-specific symptoms. Our project aims to provide a **non-invasive, fast, and accessible tool** to detect deficiencies using **images of the eyes, skin, lips, tongue, nails, and teeth**, along with reported symptoms.

Using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** like AlexNet, we classify potential deficiencies and provide **personalized dietary suggestions** to improve user health and prevent medical complications.
